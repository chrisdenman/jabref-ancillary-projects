## Creating an Ancillary Project

#### 1. Create a New (Orphan) Branch

 ```shell
   git checkout --orphan "#[JabRef Issue Number]-[lowercase-original-issue-title]--[short-description-of-project]"
   ```

The new branch is not related to `main`, it stands in its own right. It is not merged back to `main`.

#### 2. Switch to Your Branch, Toil & Commit...

#### 3. Switch back to main

#### 4. Add a Line in ยง [Ancillary Project Branches](#ancillary-project-branches)

**Note: As this project uses branches to isolation different projects, you may need to delete local temporary
directories (in particular, but not limited to: `build` & `.gradle`), before or after switching branches.**
